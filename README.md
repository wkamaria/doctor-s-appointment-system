The Online Doctor's Appointment System,  named "Afya True", is a web-based application designed to simplify and modernize the healthcare appointment process. By enabling patients to book appointments with doctors online, this system aims to enhance accessibility, reduce wait times, and improve overall patient satisfaction. Its functionality addresses common inefficiencies in traditional appointment scheduling, such as long queues, delayed communication, and lack of availability updates.
